Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset (research hate-speech detection):

Dataset using Twitter data, is was used to research hate-speech detection. The text is classified as: hate-speech, offensive language, and neither. Due to the nature of the study, itâ€™s important to note that this dataset contains text that can be considered racist, sexist, homophobic, or generally offensive.

Twitter Sentiment Analysis Context:

The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.
